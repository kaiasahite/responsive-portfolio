Project Description

This project is a portfolio equipped with boostrap grid-system and nav bar. The nave bar runs consistantly on each page allowing you to navigate through the different sites linked and the grid system allows you to view a nice, user friendly layout that also appears symetrical. Next, the picture elements all flow and resize accordingly and mailto has been set up as well.

Challenges:

By far the biggest problems for me were

1.) Going through vast amounts of information on php before realizing I could use "mailto form".

2.) Trying to get the pictures to fit in all together

3.) Figuring out how to navigate bootstrap
