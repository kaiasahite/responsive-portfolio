            Hello! My name is Kai Curtis and I'm a 25 year old male. I was born
            in Kansas, only to live there for 3 months before moving to a suburb
            of Washington D.C. until i was 3. After that we, being a military
            family, moved to Germany. we spent two years there before my mother,
            my sisters, and I came back to the States. We moved into a quiet
            town called Lynchburg in VA. I lived in that town from 1999-2016. In
            those 16 years I managed to pick up an absolute obsession for
            skateboarding which has since developed into my lifestyle. As time
            carried on skateboarding and delivering pizzas didnt seem like a
            suitable lifestyle so i came to colorado to persue the outdoors and
            a manufacturing degree. My two years spent getting my associates
            were a blast. I landed a raft guiding job based in Morrison, the
            water being clear creek. This company i worked for, Geo tours, not
            only gave me one of the best job opportunities of my life but also
            introduced me to my current girlfriend, who is spectacular. You
            reallly shouldnt need to know anymore.
